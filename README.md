# ftpfx - the new ftp client
ftpfx is a new Ftp client **totally written in scala** using **javafx** as new, beautiful gui.
It's a new approach with the idea that you need only **one client** for **all** your **systems** your using. 
(Java/Scala => Write once, use everywhere)

It all started as a project for learning scala in the university.

At the moment it's quite "java-heavy" because of all the stream, socket and javafx classes 
that it's using but i didn't find any good alternative for scala.

# Requirements
In order to use ftpfx you need several important sdk's:
 1. [Scala SDK](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/) >= 2.11.5
 2. [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) >= 8_40

(You need JDK >= 8_40 because standard-dialogues for JavaFX aren't supported below 8_40.)
